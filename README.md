# CT-Image-Segmentation-and-Classification
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution for automatic cancer segmentation using multi-modal medical imaging data, specifically CT and PET scans. The primary objective is to leverage models such as SegResNet, a 3D segmentation network, to accurately identify and segment cancerous regions within volumetric medical scans.
